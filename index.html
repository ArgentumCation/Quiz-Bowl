			<h3>What is Quiz Bowl?</h3>
			<p>Quiz Bowl is a team activity where students from different universities compete against each other on questions spanning a wide range of academic and pop culture disciplines. Questions are broken up into two general types: tossups and
				bonuses.
				On
				tossups, teams attempt to buzz in before the other team with the correct answer, demonstrating that they have superior knowledge of a subject because the clues go from hard to easy. When a team correctly answers a tossup, they are given a
				bonus
				where they can work together to answer questions on a related subject. The winner of the round is the team with the most points after 20 questions.
				Quiz Bowl is somewhat similar to Knowledge Bowl and History Bee/Bowl. We'll go over the differences at practice.

				It's a great way to reward your intellectual curiosity, learn new things, or to just have fun hanging out with interesting people.</p>
			<h3>Description of the Team</h3>
			<p>
				Quiz Bowl Team at UW is open to all students (including both undergrads and grad students) regardless of skill level or experience. We hold practices twice a week (although members are not required to attend all practices or stay the whole
				time),
				where we practice competing on questions against each other.</p>
			<h3>Quiz Bowl Tournaments</h3>
			<p>Quiz Bowl tournaments are held at universities all around the country. We play many of our tournaments against other universities over Skype, although we also travel to national tournaments in places like Palo Alto, Chicago and New York.</p>
